# Assign_Student_Papers
Program to assign papers to students based on their preferences following the Serial Dictatorship algorithm

## Notes

The program takes two CSV files as input and writes back the output to a new CSV file. Following are the details.

**Input files**
1. student_preferences.csv: Contains the Student IDs and their preferences (Student_ID, Pref1, Pref2, Pref3, Pref4)
2. papers.csv: Contains all the Paper_IDs 

**Output file**
1. assignment_result.csv: The allocation results (Student_ID, Paper_ID) are written back to this file


* It is assumed that the first row of the input files contains headers.
* The CSV files in this repository are just an example of the expected format.
